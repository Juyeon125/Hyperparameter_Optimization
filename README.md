# Hyperparameter Optimization for Neural Networks

This repository contains various methods for hyperparameter optimization of neural networks, including Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Differential Evolution.

## Installation

First, install the required libraries by running the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### 1. Run the DataSelect.py script to preprocess the data:

```sh
python DataSelect.py
```

### 2. After preprocessing the data, you can run any of the optimization scripts:

GridSearch.py for Grid Search<br>
RandomSearch.py for Random Search<br>
BayesianOptimization.py for Bayesian Optimization<br>
GeneticAlgorithm.py for Genetic Algorithm<br>
ParticleSwarmOptimization.py for Particle Swarm Optimization<br>
DifferentialEvolution.py for Differential Evolution<br>

### Example:

```sh
python GridSearch.py
```

### Replace GridSearch.py with the appropriate script name as needed.
